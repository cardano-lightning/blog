In this series we want to skip some technical details and present only the core concepts from Bitcoin Lightning Network (`BLN`) and 
how they possibly can be translated to `CL`.
We want to present them in an easy to digest form - if anything is unclear please let us know through 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CardanoLightnin) or our [GitHub](https://github.com/cardano-lightning/blog/issues) issue tracker.
Our goals is to be as transparent and well understood as we can be. 
At the same time we want to show how simple, **portable** and **lightweight** this solution can be on Cardano.
